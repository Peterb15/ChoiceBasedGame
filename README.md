<h1>Search for Humanity - A Choice Based Game</h1>
<b>Developed and Written by Peter Burke</b>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Write a proposal for your game for the rest of the semester. Keep it short, I don't want you to spend too much time on this, but here is what you should have.
For my game, I want to create a simple choice-based game that focuses on creating a compelling narrative. I am focused on creating a branching storyline with multiple endings. Additionally, I want to integrate a simple turned-based "combat" system that will have a narrative impact based on the outcome. Using a sort of morality system that moves either way based on the choices and outcome of battles with the move towards  either"binary thinking" or "conscious thought". The basic plot of this game revolves around a recently created Andriod grappling with free will and conscious thought.

  <h2>Storyboards</h2>

	<h3>Branching Storyline</h3>
	<p>
	The core mechanic of this game is a branching storyline that allows the player to make choices that will change the game.

	<h3>Morality System</h3>
	<p>
	  A simple system to represent certain choices and their impact on the player and the world around them. Unlocking or restricting certain choices based on           prior decisions.

	  A very simple rock, paper, scissors style "minigame"/ battle system that will have an impact on the morality system

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<p>
  <b>Detroit: Become Human </b> - https://www.quanticdream.com/en/detroit-become-human <be>
  <p>Easily the biggest inspiration for me, this game has one of the greatest branching storylines I have ever seen that is masterfully interwoven with a compelling narrative.</p>
  <b>Hades</b> - https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/ <be>
  <p>Looking to take inspiration from the art style and aesthetic as well as the rouge-like replayability of it.</p>
  <b>Inscription</b> - https://www.inscryption.com/ <be>
  <p>From Inscription, I plan to look at the game structure and mix-media approach to both the narrative and gameplay.</p>
